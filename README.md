# [BattleScript](https://capstone-battlescript.herokuapp.com/)

Hello! Thank you for checking out our application, BattleScript.  BattleScript is a web application that gamifies
learning algorithms with your friends and colleagues.

* **Learning-Oriented:** We take real algorithms that you may encounter in your time as a programmer,
and provide you with an embedded text-editor to write your code.  Once submitted, your code is processed 
through our built in test cases to check whether you passed or failed.
* **Social:** Bring a friend, or a few! Up to 8 players can code together, have some laughs at clever code that
failed our test cases, or view different approaches to solving the same problem!
* **Fun:** BattleScript is created with both fun and learning in mind.  As a result, we've implemented a point system
for users to allocate based on whether someone else's code made them laugh, or if they've learned a thing or two.  In the
end, the points are secondary, and what you get out of the experience in terms of fun or knowledge is what counts.

## Getting Started

From the home page, you can choose to [create or join](https://capstone-battlescript.herokuapp.com/) a room.

![home page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91397108/161794628-e1d13ae0-c84a-47b1-8647-11db3c131fc6.png)


Once you create or join a lobby, you'll notice a few things. First, you're given a random avatar to represent you.  At the top, there is the lobby code that others can use to join your game, the round number you are on, and if you are the host, a control to move the game forward.  Lastly at the bottom right is a chat bubble you can click to chat with others in the same lobby through the course of the game.

Once the host chooses to start the game, everyone is given the same prompt to solve.  You can see the progress of other players
in the table on the right-hand side.  The game will automatically move on once everyone submits, or time runs out!  If you fail,
we display our test cases and what parts you were not able to pass.

![prompt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91397108/161798592-469a2928-a25d-437f-8b8b-27ad9d2a2b66.png)

Fail voting round! Select a user on the right to view their code.  In this round, all code that didn't pass the specs are displayed, and
users can earn minimal points if they made their code funny, or got close.  Its your vote, your choice! 75 Points per vote in this round.

Pass voting round!  Select a user on the right to view their code.  In this round, all code that passed the specs are displayed, and 
users can earn full points per vote.  Choose a code based on your preference, whether their solution was optimal, clever, anything you deem
worthy.  Again, your vote, your choice!  250 points per vote in this round!

![pass vote round](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91397108/161799792-120f29bc-9d7a-47a9-a77d-04a5cc0666ee.png)

Tallying round!  Everyone's points are shown with their total points on the left, and their earned points this round on the right.
You can also view how many points a user has received from each type of round.  The host must click continue in their bar to move the game
forward.

Once the host clicks continue, the round starts over again with a new algorithm problem.  This goes on for four rounds, and the player
with the most points by the end is the winner, but the real winners are everyone who had fun and gained some knowledge along the way!



## Upcoming features
